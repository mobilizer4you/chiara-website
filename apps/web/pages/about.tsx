              TikStock&apos;s story began during lockdown, when the green
              portfolios of successful traders started turning red. Now unsure
              of which direction the market was headed, we were left with an
              unsettling feelingâ€¦.
              <br />
              A feeling that made us question how many others were forced into
              the same dilemma. As many retail investors entered the market, our
              team here at TikStock dedicated themselves to the creation of this
              platform. A platform that allows users to gain key insights into
              their favorite stocks, cryptos, indexes and more.
              <br />
              Not only have we&apos;ve partnered with award winning fintech
              leaders to provide users with top market analytics, but we&apos;ve
              made it our focus to deliver this information to you with an
              attractive design at an affordable price.

                    As traders ourselves who studied books, watched videos and
                    took expensive online courses in attempts to learn the
                    secrets to market conquering, we took to the interne to find
                    an affordable and comprehensive alternative. A platform
                    where beginners can go to dive deep without feeling
                    overwhelmed. We failed.
